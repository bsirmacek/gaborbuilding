# gaborbuilding
Urban region and building detection based on gabor filters and probabilistic theory

# main file
Use main.m to test the existing demo.

# parameters
Please read the code line by line. There are few parameters (non-linear filter parameters, vote weight, region threshold) 
which need to be adjusted for your image resolution.

# reference article
If you use the code, do not forget to cite:
